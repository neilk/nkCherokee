This directory contains:

* nkCherokee.ttf -- this is the font file. Consult your operating system help to learn how
to install it

* nkCherokee-grid.pdf -- a sampler of how the font looks, in the traditional grid arrangement
of Cherokee syllabary.

* Cherokee Font Key Strokes.html -- contains info on the keyboard mapping. It is the same as the
"traditional" Cherokee font that was in common use around 2002, when this font was designed.

* LICENSE.txt -- contains information about copyright and licensing.


Additional notes on the design:

After almost a decade (!) there are several things that I am unhappy about with this font. The
design of a few characters could be improved, particularly NV. If you would like to adopt this 
font I would suggest a revision there. I would have done it myself but I am having trouble with
my font-editing software and I did not want to delay getting this font to you any longer.

Hope you find this useful. The source files for the font are available on request as well.
