Additional notes on the design:

This font does not use the proper unicode page for Cherokee, as it was designed as a 
drop-in replacement for the traditional Cherokee nation font, which uses another keyboard mapping. 
Multi-glyph characters have also been replicated.
See: http://www.cherokee.org/Culture/Font/Keyboard.htm

After almost a decade (!) there are several things that I am unhappy about with this font. The
design of a few characters could be improved, particularly NV. If you would like to adopt this 
font I would suggest a revision there. I would have done it myself but I am having trouble with
my font-editing software at the moment.
